# Description
<p>This app was developed in 8 hours as a gift for the Co:Create Ink team. It reflects my expertise in building cross-platform mobile applications using modern technologies such as Expo, React Native, and Tamagui. This project aims to demonstrate how my technical skills can contribute to Co:Create's mission of merging technology with artistry in the tattoo industry.</p>

# Technical details
<p>The project was developed using the following technology stack, ensuring scalability, cross-platform compatibility, and smooth user experience:</p>

- React Native: To provide a seamless user experience on iOS and Android with a single codebase.
- Expo: For rapid cross-platform development and easy over-the-air (OTA) updates and web support.
- Typescript: For ensuring type safety and reducing runtime errors by catching issues at compile time.
- Tamagui: This is for styling and optimizing performance while maintaining visual consistency across platforms.
- Expo router: For file-based navigation, allowing for a simplified and scalable routing system across the project. This approach makes it easier to handle routes in a large app with multiple views and features, such as artist portfolios or booking screens.
